### Use issues for everything

- For a small change, just send a PR.
- For bigger changes open an issue for discussion before sending a PR.
- PR should have:
  - Test case
  - Documentation
  - Example (If it makes sense)
  - You can also contribute by:
  - Reporting issues
  - Suggesting new features or enhancements
  - Improve/fix documentation
